I made this project as part of my academic curriculum. The project is primarily an E- Learning Portal which focused on providing the rudimentary courses for Computer Science undergraduates that involved courses like Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating System , Database Management System, Theory of Computation and many more. The portal provided video lectures ,eBooks and quizzes for the respective course where the learner can evaluate their knowledge.The portal also included a discussion forum where learners could post their queries and discussion among learners can take place. Technologies used for completion of the project are Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX
